# Sudoku Puzzle Solver using AI

## Overview
This project implements a **Sudoku Puzzle Solver** using **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques. It includes two algorithms:

- **Arc-Consistency 3 (AC-3) Algorithm**
- **Backtracking Algorithm**

A graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** allows users to interact with the solver, select difficulty levels, and visualize the puzzle-solving process.

## Features
- **Solve Sudoku puzzles using AC-3 and Backtracking algorithms**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter**
- **Choose difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard**
- **Compare execution time of both algorithms**
- **Dataset support for multiple Sudoku puzzles**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muradhameed59/Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver.git
   cd Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Select a Sudoku puzzle from the dataset.
3. Choose an algorithm (AC-3 or Backtracking) to solve the puzzle.
4. View the solved puzzle and compare execution times.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI Development)
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Techniques**
- **AC-3 Algorithm**
- **Backtracking Algorithm**
